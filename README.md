# Exoskeleton-Project
Inspired by the Ekso GT exoskeleton, and having visted senior nursing homes before, I decided to make an entirely new project. This project was one that allows for greater mobilitiy for seniors citizens.

This was when the open source exoskeleton suit was born

## The idea is to:
  - Construct a Biomechanically inspired suit
      - That allows for easier mobilitiy
        - Eventually allow support for respirator systems, oxygen tanks or even aritificial lungs/pumps
      - One of the inspirations was this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=gplA6pq9cOs)
  - Custom eeg compatibility that can help with other things as well (Will talk more about this later) may be possible
